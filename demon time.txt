Finally my high school is completed, me and my circle dicided to go on trip near a home town it is a basic holy or more probably scared place . I had only feww friends due to my introverted
nature, and they are the one i know from my childhood days after getting them i not feel to make new "close" friends anymore they are all the friend that i need, their name were Michael, Sam, and 
Andrew. I used to know Micheal since like forever as far i cannot even remember the first day i met him, at this time i treat him more like a actual brother than as a friend. I met Sam and Andrew much 
later
